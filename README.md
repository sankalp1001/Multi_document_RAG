# Multi_document_RAG
This Streamlit app lets users upload and query multiple PDFs using NLP. It extracts, chunks, and embeds text with HuggingFace's Instruct model, storing it in a FAISS vector store for efficient retrieval. Powered by the `google/flan-t5-xxl` model, the app enables interactive Q&amp;A based on document content, with a simple interface for seamless use.
